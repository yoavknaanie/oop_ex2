1. We decided to use the 2nd strategy, we sent an instance of BrickerGameManager to the Brick calss
and used the game manger public method removeBrick(GameObject gameObject) to remove a brick from the game.
The advantages of this design is encapsulation - the bricker game manager is the only class who adds
and removes objects to the game.
2.

We decided to give Paddle another attributes: screenLeftBorder, screenrightBorder so the class Paddle will
be able to prevent the paddle to get out the screen borders.
We changed private void createUserPaddle() to public void createUserPaddle() so AddPaddleStrategy class
would be able be able to create another paddle using its attribute of BrickerGameManager.
