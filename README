We decided to give Paddle another attributes: screenLeftBorder, screenrightBorder so the class Paddle will
be able to prevent the paddle to get out the screen borders.
We changed private void createUserPaddle() to public void createUserPaddle() so AddPaddleStrategy class
would be able be able to create another paddle using its attribute of BrickerGameManager.
